## What is ScheduleMaster?

ScheduleMaster is a demo application designed to help university students plan their academic schedule efficiently prior to their registration appointment. With this tool, students can visualize the available course offerings, search and filter based on their preferences, and avoid schedule conflicts between selected subjects. Additionally, the application generates a document with the final schedule.

## Features

- Course Search and Filtering: Allows students to search and filter available courses based on their criteria.
- Course Selection: Enables students to select and add courses to their schedule.
- Schedule Conflict Detection: Notifies students when there are schedule conflicts between selected courses.
- Schedule Editing: Allows students to add and remove selected courses from their schedule.
- Schedule Download: Enables students to download their schedule as a plain text document.

## Technologies used

- Python: The programming language used to develop the ScheduleMaster application.
- Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating the application's graphical user interface.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database used to store and retrieve course data.
